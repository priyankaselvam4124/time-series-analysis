Objective
This project analyzes stock price movements using time series techniques. We compute moving averages, daily returns, and risk metrics, then visualize trends and distributions.

Key Features
✅ Moving Averages (10, 20, 30 days) – Trend smoothing for price analysis.
✅ Daily Return Calculation – Measures percentage change in stock price.
✅ Risk Analysis – Uses standard deviation to quantify volatility.
✅ Visualization – KDE plots, histograms, and bar charts for insights.

Technologies Used
🔹 Pandas – Data manipulation and feature engineering
🔹 Matplotlib & Seaborn – Data visualization
🔹 NumPy – Numerical operations

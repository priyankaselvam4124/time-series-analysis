Objective
This project analyzes stock price movements using time series techniques. We compute moving averages, daily returns, and risk metrics, then visualize trends and distributions.

Key Features
- ✅ Moving Averages (10, 20, 30 days) – Trend smoothing for price analysis.
- ✅ Daily Return Calculation – Measures percentage change in stock price.
- ✅ Risk Analysis – Uses standard deviation to quantify volatility.
- ✅ Visualization – KDE plots, histograms, and bar charts for insights.

Technologies Used
- 🔹 Pandas – Data manipulation and feature engineering
- 🔹 Matplotlib & Seaborn – Data visualization
- 🔹 NumPy – Numerical operations
